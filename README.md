# TreeDistance
An implementation of the gradient boosted tree distance presented in "Tree Space Prototypes: Another Look at Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable".

To compute the GBT-based proximity matrix on sklearn's Digits dataset, run
python compute_proximity.py

(check the proximityCGB function in compute_proximity.py for different variations of the proximity matrix computation)
