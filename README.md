# TreeDistance
An implementation of the tree distance presented in "Tree space prototypes: Another look at making tree ensembles interpretable. S Tan, M Soloviev, G Hooker, and MT Wells. In FODS 2020"

To compute the GBT-based proximity matrix on sklearn's Digits dataset:
python compute_proximity.py

(check the proximityCGB function in compute_proximity.py for different variations of the proximity matrix computation)
